				<h1>Entertainment Options</h1>Please ask us.  We can provide music for your ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, etc. We can accommodate most musical situations with either a pianist, vocalist, and/or  a jazz trio and more.

                    <h1>LIVE IS BETTER</h1>  As much as the trend is to have a DJ, there is truly no comparison between having a band or a DJ.  Energy, response, and making it a special night.  Nothing is better than "LIVE".  Please ask anyone that has had a live band or call one of our contacts about us. In addition, we can incorporate any of the more recent music on CD's, so you don't need to get a DJ!
